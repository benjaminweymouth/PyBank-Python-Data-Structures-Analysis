* This repository includes python Jupyter notebooks and associated files for the PyBank and PyRamen Exercises.

* The purpose of this code is to demonstrate Python proficiency in working with CSV files, lists, dictionaries, loops and particulary nested data structures. 

Here there is a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a fictional company. I utilize a dataset: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. 

The script will utilze the following actions / methods. 

- The total number of months included in the dataset.


- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.


- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.


- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.


- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
