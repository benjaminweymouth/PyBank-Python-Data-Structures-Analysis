In two separate Python scripts, I perform financial analysis of csv datasets. This analysis features two examples, each with a separate dataset, and each exploring different Python methods and data structures.

The two examples are as follows:

[PyBank](https://github.com/benjaminweymouth/Python-Data-Structures-PyBank-PyRamen/blob/main/PyBank/main.ipynb): where I utilize a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a fictional company.  

[PyRamen](https://github.com/benjaminweymouth/Python-Data-Structures-PyBank-PyRamen/blob/main/PyRamen/main.ipynb): The purpose of this code is to analyze a businessâ€™s financial performance by cross-referencing their sales data with internal product data to figure out revenues and costs for the year.
